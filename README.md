FORUM SERVER

There are two files: ForumServer.py - the server program that accepts clients
                     ForumClient.py - the client program that can read and make posts in groups
                     
1. To run these first unzip the package
2. Run the server: python ForumServer.py - take note of the host machine and the port number specified in the server code (60000)
3. Run the client: python ForumClient.py SERVER_MACHINE PORT_NUMBER - specify where to connect to the server
4. After that you are free to use the client
